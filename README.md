Sale System

This is a POS System that can be used in online stores
it's features include:
  - Account System, This feature allows the user to create an account and log in. Some items like account information will be saved in the account.
  - Menu System, This feature displays the menu using a given excel file. The given excel file makes it so that it is easy to change the menu and the code is also scaleable to the excel file so no matter how much items you add the code will be able to read the excel file
  - Cart System, This feature allows the user to add to cart the items in the menu. The cart system is used with the menu and its scaled with the menu system
 
 Other Planned Features These features may or may not be added to the final code:
  - save and load cart system, this feature would allow the user to save his cart for later use 
  - proper encryption of accounts, the current accounts are stored in a txt file which is unsafe. this might provide to be difficult so this feature is less likely to be in the final code
